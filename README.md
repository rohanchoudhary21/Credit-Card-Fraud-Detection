# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This repository contains source code for a model built for fraud detection in credit card transactions. 

• Built a robust model that effectively differentiates between legitimate and fraudulent trans-
actions, providing valuable insights for fraud prevention and minimizing financial losses.

• Employed Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to uncover anomalies by comparing the local
density of transactions, effectively capturing deviations from normal patterns.

• Applied the Isolation Forest algorithm to effectively identify outliers within the credit card dataset
by taking into account the intrinsic differences between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
